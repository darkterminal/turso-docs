description: Trace slow queries and capture SQL errors with Sentry.
---

The [Sentry](https://sentry.io/integrations/turso) integration for `@libsql/client` provides tracing, breadcrumbs, and error handling for SQL queries.

<Snippet file="technical-preview-banner.mdx" />

## Install

```bash
npm install sentry-integration-libsql-client
```

## Quickstart

Once you have a `@libsql/client` instance, you can integrate it with Sentry like this:

```ts
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/node";
import { createClient } from "@libsql/client";
import { libsqlIntegration } from "sentry-integration-libsql-client";

const libsqlClient = createClient({
  url: "libsql://...",
  authToken: "...",
});

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "...",
  integrations: [libsqlIntegration(libsqlClient, Sentry)],
});

await libsqlClient.execute("SELECT * FROM users");
```

## Options

By default, everything is turned on. You can configure what you want by passing a third argument to the `libsqlIntegration` function.

| Option        | Default | Description                            |
| ------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `tracing`     | `true`  | Enable tracing for SQL queries.        |
| `breadcrumbs` | `true`  | Enable breadcrumbs for SQL queries.    |
| `errors`      | `true`  | Enable error handling for SQL queries. |

```ts
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "...",
  integrations: [
    libsqlIntegration(libsqlClient, Sentry, {
      tracing: false,
      breadcrumbs: false,
      errors: false,
    }),
  ],
});
```
